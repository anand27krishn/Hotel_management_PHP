            The Mauryan empire, nearly 2000 years ago, was the pride and envy of the ancient world.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This was when Chandragupta Maurya elevated the King to the status of a Hero, revolutionizing<br /> the way the state was run and laying the foundations of a greater India. The King found an able partner in Chanakya,<br /> his mentor and strategist in chief, and the legend behind the Arthashashtra, the document that continues to lay down<br />the rules of statesmanship in the modern day.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By the time it was Ashoka's moment to grace the coveted throne, the shine of Pataliputra (the name Patna was<br /> known by at the time) had touched the far corners of the globe. King Ashoka merely stepped things further. As he<br /> embraced Buddhism, harmony and peace became the founding pillars of a new state, and a new era of glory.<br /> This was also the time when the legend of Nalanda university took shape, as it became the epicenter of pioneering<br /> progresses in education, and a shrine of unparalleled thought leadership.<br /><br />Patna was the timeless land of those who dared to rise. It was India's time of triumph. And a nation's finest hour.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Today, for those ready to peel away the layers of history, the allure of Patna remains intact. In evey hood, on every<br /> street. In the new millennium, be it heritage or cuisine, culture or creativity, Pataliputra, the city where it all began, continues<br /> to stand singular, sensuous, supreme.
